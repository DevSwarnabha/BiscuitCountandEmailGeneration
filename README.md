# BiscuitCount

The dataset is entirely composed by me and is varied to suit all conditions.
The model is trained on yolo8.pt because of its low computational cost and ease of training
The video stream is taken through an ip camera and predicts based on it.
The model output is presented using a barchart to update the data in real time. 
The output is mailed to the specific email address. 
The whole thing can be made into a deployable exe and run it without any dependencies externally downloaded.
